# Testing

## Local gates

```sh
make test
make test-race
make ci-local          # fmt-check, vet, unit tests, race, WASM compile
```

Unit coverage includes path normalization, slug generation, UTF-16 caption
budgets, JSON envelopes, secret redaction, operation locks, and SQLite
migrations.

## Offline CLI

`TD_FAKE_TELEGRAM=1` runs the CLI against the in-memory fake Telegram client
(no network). Set `TD_FAKE_TELEGRAM_STATE=<path>` to persist login, channels,
and uploaded bytes across invocations.

The fake login code is `12345`. The full command surface — login, init, cp,
ls, get, mv, rm, scan, share — can be exercised this way.

Integration tests under `internal/service` use the same fake for upload,
scan, move, delete, repair, and crash-recovery paths.

## Manual tests

Real-account checks need a Telegram account, `api_id`, and `api_hash`. Use a
private test channel. Sequence and caveats:
